# KISSMMU
A super simple MMU designed for Voron 3D printers.

Easy and low cost multi material filament solution that replaces your exhaust cover on a Voron Trident or Voron V2.4 printer.

Uses CW2 or CW1 for the feeders, which are bowden style extruders that sync with your extruder to load and unload filament from the toolhead using a filament splitter.

You can use a tool head sensor or not use one, or whatever configuration of sensors you want to detect filament runout, clogs etc.

No filament buffers are needed.
